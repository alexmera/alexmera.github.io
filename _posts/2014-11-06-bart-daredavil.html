<p>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman &mdash; and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."</p>

<h2>Homer Alone</h2>
<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>

    <li>Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</li>
    <li>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</li>
    <li>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow&hellip;and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</li>

<h3>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h3>
<p>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is&hellip; Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? Ahoy hoy?</p>
<h4>Last Exit to Springfield</h4>
<p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>

    <li>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?</li>
    <li>D'oh.</li>

<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</p>
