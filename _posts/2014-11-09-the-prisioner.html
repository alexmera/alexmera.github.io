<p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Kids have names? Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>

<h2>Lesser of Two Evils</h2>
<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. You are the last hope of the universe. You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</p>
<ul>
    <li>It's a T. It goes "tuh".</li>
    <li>Ask her how her day was.</li>
    <li>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I, Roommate</h3>
<p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Kif might! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
<h4>A Big Piece of Garbage</h4>
<p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</p>
<ol>
    <li>I'm a thing.</li>
    <li>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</li>
    <li>Take me to your leader!</li>
    <li>Ask her how her day was.</li>
    <li>Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</li>
</ol>
<h5>War Is the H-Word</h5>
<p>I wish! It's a nickel. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Take me to your leader! Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</p>
