<p>Dad didn't leave&hellip; When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity.</p>

<h2>Natural Born Kissers</h2>
<p>Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. D'oh. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!</p>

    <li>&hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</li>
    <li>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds&hellip;it makes ice.</li>

<p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? I was saying "Boo-urns." You don't win friends with salad.</p>
<h4>Marge vs. Monorail</h4>
<p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Here's to alcohol, the cause of &mdash; and solution to &mdash; all life's problems.</p>

This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Save me, Jeebus. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</p>
