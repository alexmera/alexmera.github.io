<p>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the&hellip;uh&hellip;what cures cancer? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>

<h2>Homer the Great</h2>
<p>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. I was saying "Boo-urns." Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Here's to alcohol, the cause of &mdash; and solution to &mdash; all life's problems.</p>

    <li>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</li>
    <li>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman &mdash; and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</li>

<h3>Natural Born Kissers</h3>
<p>Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Ahoy hoy?</p>
<h4>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h4>
<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Homer no function beer well without. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>

    <li>D'oh.</li>
    <li>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds&hellip;it makes ice.</li>
    <li>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</li>

<h5>Duffless</h5>
<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Human contact: the final frontier.</p>
